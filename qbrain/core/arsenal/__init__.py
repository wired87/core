"""
please convert it again to simpple py defs. keep return statement ,
comment and create equations require loops into sub methods-> add
return key and implement it within the equations who use it.
Each functino must cary just a single equation, no nested fucntion
calls and return just the unique single variable (no dict->just var,
variable name must be same as method name without "calc_") collects
the result of the equation and must be implmement it within other
equaitons require it

Focus on correct arg passing of params (incl retrun keys),
avoid unnecessary def wrappers  e.g. just return apram,
methods must collect, avoid optional unused params,
the equations must have highly field specific (math/physics etc)
relevance, return in single file block

interaction and differential equations requeire the same parameter twice must start with _ (self) or end with _
(neighbor - (single (_) for plus neighbor, double (__) for minus neighbor and more for another)


interaction equaitons never cary the sam value of more then 2 point inside
