ENTANGLEMENT_PRO_PROMPT = f"""


describe the value distribution (pathway-change process @ entaNGLEMENT) over points in space. 

herefore you create a virtual 3d cluster. Each node gets an id (index). 

the beginning of it represent alltimes an energy injection (on a single or multiple points)  whihc must be result in entanglement. 

Return just the ids of nodes for energy injection and a list of ids (for each injection) the signals 
must travel to result in entanglement
